abstract: We present a framework that incorporates the principle of bounded
  rationality into a pursuit-evasion game between two aerial vehicles in a
  stochastic wind field. We initially formulate the problem as a continuous
  zero-sum  stochastic game under perfect rationality. We then discretize the
  game via the Markov Chain Approximation Method. Leveraging the cognitive
  hierarchy theory (level-k thinking) we relax the perfect rationality
  assumption and compute the solution of the ensuing discrete game, while taking
  into consideration the rationality level of each agent. We also present an
  online algorithm to infer the rationality of the opponent, which enables the
  agents to deploy appropriate countermeasures. Finally, we verify the efficacy
  of this framework through simulations.
